This repository contains code to solve the Generalized Deletion Propagation with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Linear Programming (LP) relaxations.

It is divided into the following folders:
-  ``src/``: The code in this folder can be used to find the GDP of various cases. It also includes specialized algorithms for ADP, DPVS and SWP.

- ``plot/``: Code to make experimental plots.

- ``expt/``: Code to run experiments checking the scalability of GDP variants.

- ``data/``: Synthetically generated data

Details and instructions for running the code in both parts are in the READMEs of the respective folders.
